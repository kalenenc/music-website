	<p>I graduate from Duquesne University in the Spring of 2018. Throughout high school, I was a member of the Junior Mendelssohn Choir of Pittsburgh where I was fortunate to be surrounded by people who share my same love for singing. I went to a performing arts high school where I first discovered my love of all things music, and my true love for opera started to blossom. I have taken part in 4 different operas so far, one of them through the Pittsburgh Opera. When I'm not singing, I enjoy playing the piano, watching videos, and spending time with my family and friends.</p>
